# Customisation for DNN Society

[DNN Socity Wordpress Instance](https://dnnsociety.org/)

This repo contains the custom codes to DNN's Wordpress. Please include here all code level modifications, i.e., those that can not be implemented by simple CMS operation. There is no complete folder structure or naming convention at present. Please use your judgement when following guidelines do not cover your case.

## Convention

* Send one FYI PR upon change -- fork to a new branch, save your latest work, create a PR, merge it directly yourself. `@hupili` in the PR thread. This works as FYI function.

## List of customisations

* `custom.css` -- The site wide custom CSS file. You usually find this input box in the "Appearance -> Customize -> Additional CSS" section.
* `widget-*` -- Some widgets allow HTML codes. We store those HTML codes here once the online version is modified.
