# Customisation for DNN Society

[DNN Socity Wordpress Instance](https://dnnsociety.org/)

This repo contains the custom codes to DNN's Wordpress. Please include here all code level modifications, i.e., those that can not be implemented by simple CMS operation. There is no complete folder structure or naming convention at present. Please use your judgement when following guidelines do not cover your case.

## List of customisations

* `custom.css` -- The site wide custom CSS file.
* `widget-*` -- Some widgets allow HTML codes. We store those HTML codes here once the online version is modified.
